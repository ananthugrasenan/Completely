README
------
This file contains general description and instructions for the Completely project.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
-----------------
Source files are under Completely/src/main
Test files are under Completely/src/test
Test data in csv files under Completely/resources

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
The easiest way to run is by running the CommandInput class that has a main method. This will
provide a commandline interface where users can issue available commands.

User commands:
add [word] [score]
	Example: add chair 54
load [path]
	Example: load resources/wordscores01.csv
complete [prefix]
	Example: complete ch
clear
	Example: clear
write [path]
	Example: write tmp/dict1.json
read [path]
	Example: read tmp/dict1.json
Enter 'q!' to quit

All commands except "clear" can be issued using the first letter as shortcut.
Example: a chair 54
is the same as: add chair 54

Another option is to run the unit tests in the Completely/src/test directory.

In the test data in csv format under Completely/resources, words are scored
in the 1-100 range.
